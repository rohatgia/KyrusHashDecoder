# KyrusHashDecoder
This is a set of Node.JS programs which allows one to decrypt the puzzle.txt file available on the Kyrus Technologies website

This requires the npm install of js-sha3 (npm install js-sha3) (https://github.com/emn178/js-sha3)

This makes use of the MD5 Hashing (and its dependencies) from cryptii (https://github.com/cryptii/cryptii). Selected files are included in this repository
